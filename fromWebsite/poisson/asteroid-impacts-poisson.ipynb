    "# Introduction: Simulating Asteroid Impacts with a Poisson Process\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will simulate impacts of Near Earth Asteroids on Earth using a Poisson process. Asteroid impacts can be modeled as a Poisson process because they are independent of one another, the chance of an impact occurring does not change over time, and two events (asteroid impacts) do not occur at the same time. We know the average time between impacts for each size of asteroid (we'll get into this) but not the exact time between impacts and moveover, one impact does not affect the chance of the next. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a Poisson Process model to calculate the expected number of impacts over an individual's life for each size of asteroid. We can also use the same model to calculate the expected waiting time between asteroid impacts. Although this model - like all models - is an approximation and the data are based on limited observations, we can still get real practice using a Poisson process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Poisson Process and Poisson Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The Poisson Process and Poisson Distribution are explained in [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-poisson-distribution-and-poisson-process-explained-4e2cb17d459). Basically, a Poisson process is an appropriate model for events that occur with limited frequency where we know the average frequency (or equivalently the average time between events). The Poisson Distribution allows us to calculate the expected number of events in a time period given the average time between events. The Poisson distribution is a special case of the Binomial Distribution where the number of trials is much greater than the expected number of successes. As asteroid impacts are relatively rare, this assumption fits well. For more on the Poisson Distribution, see [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution#Basics). \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll get into the equations where needed and compare the theoretical values to our values derived from actual data and simulations. "

    "In this notebook, we used a Poisson process to simulate asteroid impacts on Earth. Using a Poisson Process model and the Poisson Distribution, we are able to calculate the expected number of impacts over a time period and the waiting time between impacts. While this may be a somewhat theoretical exercise (because of the limited data), it shows how we can apply a statistical concept to arrive at plausible answers. Furthermore, it gives us a chance to get familiar with running simulations and comparing actual results to expected results from theory. Data science often involves comparing reality with theory and exercises like these can help us learn the basics and how to interpret the outcomes."
